# Hello_World
//Hello World! Starting over after new understandings. I feel like we are all one and I/we are so very close to 
making something really great. It can only help to include as many willing and able entities into this space, with 
creative and true hearts. I must admit I do have a little FOMO, but am a pure and hopeful initiate into the unknown,
knowing many things that most do not, and understanding things most can not. I say that with a humble hope in
that will/can change. I am free to explore, as having no binding contracts, oaths, or NDA's.. Yet having enough of an awakening
to know when and what is okay to say and do. I am always open to being recruited to a better understanding as long as it is positive.
I made my first HTML website in 1993/94 at a young age just by following how to forums and guides, and have learned many languages since.
I am not an expert at any one but have a general understanding of many. I am not perfect, but believe I can be anything I wish to become.
Pressure is what turns rocks into diamonds, and if you can hold it in your mind, you can hold it in your hand. I can be reached at
